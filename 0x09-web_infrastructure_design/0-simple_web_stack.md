EXPLANATION FOR TASK 0
Server:
The server is a physical or virtual machine (in this case, with IP 8.8.8.8) responsible for hosting and serving the web application.

Domain Name:
The domain name, foobar.com, is a human-readable alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). It's used for users to access the website by typing www.foobar.com in their browsers.

DNS Record:
The DNS record for www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, pointing to the domain foobar.com. This record resolves www.foobar.com to the IP address of the server (8.8.8.8).

Web Server (Nginx):
The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP requests from users' browsers. It receives requests for www.foobar.com and communicates with the application server to retrieve dynamic content.

Application Server:
The application server hosts the application files (code base). It executes application logic and processes dynamic content requests from the web server. In this scenario, it could be running a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack.

Database (MySQL):
MySQL is used as the database server to store and manage the website's data. The application server communicates with the database server to fetch or update information dynamically.

Communication with User's Computer:
The communication between the server and the user's computer is facilitated through the HTTP protocol. The user's browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which, in turn, processes the request and communicates with the application server and database as needed. The response is then sent back to the user's browser.


Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
The infrastructure has a single server, making it vulnerable to failures. If the server goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible. To mitigate this, redundancy measures like load balancing and failover systems should be implemented.

Downtime During Maintenance:
Deploying new code may require restarting the web server, resulting in downtime. To address this, a more sophisticated deployment strategy, such as blue-green deployment or canary releases, can be employed to minimize user impact during updates.

Scalability Challenges:
The infrastructure may struggle to handle a significant increase in incoming traffic. To scale, additional servers, load balancing, and potentially a CDN (Content Delivery Network) can be introduced to distribute the load and enhance performance.
